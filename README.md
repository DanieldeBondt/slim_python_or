# slim_python_or
An altered version of slim-python built using Python 3.7 and the Google OR Tools Python API in combination with the CBC default MIP solver.

The original package was developed by Berk Ustun to which all credit goes for developing the Supersparse Linear Integer Model.
Further details and examples can be found on his [github page](https://github.com/ustunb/slim-python)
